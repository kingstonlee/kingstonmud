RANK TOPPLAYERS

Usage: rank [ <player name> | topplayers ]

The rank command will show the targetted mortal's (should there be one)
standing with respect to the rest of the mortals in the game.  If there
is no argument given, the targetted player will be thyself.  If the 
argument "topplayers" is given, the highest ranked mortals will be 
displayed.
