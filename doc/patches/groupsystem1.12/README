Readme Version 1.1

Files:
  1) README:        This file

Before you begin: 

             IMPORTANT     IMPORTANT     IMPORTANT     IMPORTANT
  1) This patch is designed for tbaMUD 3.63, revision 306, if you are currently
     operating a stock tbaMUD 3.63 installation, you will need to visit tbaMUD.com
     and upgrade to the atleast revision 306, through the online SVN.

     http://tbamud.com/websvn/                OR (If it works)
     http://tbamud.com/websvn/comp.php?repname=tbaMUD&path=%2F&compare[]=%2F@305&compare[]=%2F@306 

  2) I assume no responsibility for any damage this causes in your MUD, apply at your
     own risk.

  3) Feel free to use this in anyway you see fit.

What this does:

  This patch seperates the follower system used for following behind another
player, and the group system used by a fellowship of players for the benefit
of combat support. 

Things to note:

  1) This patch does away with AFF_GROUP, that affect slot may now be used else
     where.
  2) This patch does away with do_ungroup.
  3) This patch makes use of the tbaMUD 3.63 list system (written by me), and
     attempting to patch this into tbaMUD 3.62 or prior will be difficult.

Installation:
 
  1) Place this patch in your tbaMUD/src.
  2) type:
       patch -p1 < group.patch
  
  3) If it patches in flawlessly move to step 5.
  
  4) If the patch wasn't 100% successful you will have to hand patch the rest
     in by hand. The MAJORITY of code is within act.other.c and handler.c, as
     such I put those functions (ripped from code) in seperate files for a
     quicker copy & paste patch job.

  5) Now that the source has been successfully patched, remove UNGROUP from your
     helpfiles and replace the helpfile for GROUP with the new one supplied.

  6) Have fun.

  7) Feel free to send any bugs to me either through the tbamud.com forums, or
     by email at joseph.arnusch@gmail.com .
